# Day 01: Band Name Generator

Welcome to **Day 01** of my **100 Days of Python Challenge**! 🚀  
This repository contains a beginner-friendly Python project: a **Band Name Generator**. 

## 📝 Project Description

The Band Name Generator is a fun and interactive script that generates a creative name for your band. It takes user input for:
1. Your Name 
2. The City where the band is based  
3. The Band's Favorite Food

Using this information, the script creates a unique band name by combining the city name and the favorite food.

🛠️ How to Run
    Clone this repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Day01-BandNameGenerator.git

    Navigate to the project directory:
    cd Day01-BandNameGenerator

    Run the Python script:
    python band_name_generator.py

🔗 Output Example
		Here’s what the program might look like in action:
		Welcome to the Band Name Generator! 
		Enter your name: Alex
		Enter the name of the city your band is based: Seattle
		Enter the name of the band's favourite food: Tacos
		Hey Alex
		I think your band should be named as Seattle's Tacos

🎯 Purpose
		The goal of this project is to:

		Practice using Python's input() function to gather user data.
		Combine strings dynamically based on user inputs.
		Create engaging and entertaining beginner-level Python scripts.
	
 🌟 Acknowledgments
		Inspired by the 100 Days of Python Challenge, this project serves as a stepping stone towards building more complex Python programs.
